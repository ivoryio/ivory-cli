# ivory-cli
Ivory CLI üêò is a tool for developing, testing and deploying SPA web applications build with the Ivory Pod Architecture (IPA).

In a nutshell with IPA you create [micro-frontends](https://micro-frontends.org/) and [microservices](https://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html), bundle them in a pod and deploy the pod in the AWS cloud.

To create a SPA web application with IPA you can use the CLI to:

1. Create a project by running the command: **ivory create**
2. Configure the project by running the command: **ivory configure**
3. Deploy the entire project or individual microservices by running the command: **ivory deploy**
4. Create a new pod by running the command: **ivory create**
