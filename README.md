# ivory-cli
Ivory CLI üêò is a tool for developing, testing and deploying Web SPAs (Single Page Applications) using the Ivory Pod Architecture (IPA).

In a nutshell with IPA you create UI packages and microservices, and deploy them in the AWS cloud.

To create an Ivory App you can use the CLI to:

1. Create a project by running the command: **ivory create**

You can choose between 2 App types:

a) Hello - which contains the basics for a SPA Web app (SignUp, SignIn & SignOut)

b) Marketplace - which is work in progress and will contain the basics for a SPA Web Marketplace

2. Deploy the app by running the command: **ivory deploy**

The deploy command must be executed in an Ivory App root folder. The command will create the CI/CD pipelines and it will deploy the microservices and the Web SPA build files.

The deploy command will take between 30-45 minutes to finish as it creates a global CloudFront distribution. 

## Prerequisites
In order to use the Ivory CLI you need:
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Git
3. [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

You will also need to configure AWS on your local machine:

1. [Configuring the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)
2. [Setting Up for AWS CodeCommit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up.html)
