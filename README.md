# ivory-cli
Ivory CLI üêò is a tool for developing, testing and deploying Web SPAs (Single Page Applications) using the Ivory recommended template and AWS Amplify.

In a nutshell with this template you get commonplace functionalities out of the box, and the ability to deploy them in the AWS cloud.

You can create a new project by running the command: **`ivory create`**


## Prerequisites
In order to use the Ivory CLI you need:
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable)
3. [Amplify CLI](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/install)
4. [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) (if you want to use codecommit)

You will also need to have an [AWS named profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html) configured on your local machine, that has permissions to access the AWS account where you want the new app to be hosted and specifies your prefered region (check [Known issues](#known-issues-or-limitations) below).


## Installation

```javascript
yarn global add @ivoryio/ivory-cli
```
or
```javascript
npm i -g @ivoryio/ivory-cli
```

## Creating your first project
1. Run **`ivory create`** command in CLI where you want the project folder to be created
1. Specify **name** for the project
1. Choose **AWS profile**
1. Choose which **git platform** you will be using. (CodeCommit repo is created by the command, for the other options you'll need to create the repo separately)
1. Wait for the magic to finish. And you‚Äôll have initial project structure, all stacks created, a repository created and all services deployed.


## Known issues or limitations

1. Please make sure that you have specified your prefered `region` (and `output`) in `~/.aws/config` file
1. Project name must satisfy the following regular expression: (\w+)
1. Some amplify configurations can not be automated yet, so a few manual steps are still need in the Amplify console to ensure an optimal experience
    * In the Amplify Console, on the homepage of your app, click the **Edit** text next to "*Continuous deploys set up*", select `master` backend environment and save.
    * Under **Build settings**, replace the build spec provided with the contents of the `amplify.yml` file in the root of your new project.
